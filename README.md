# Whitemane BugTracker

This BugTracker is a tool to report any issues, errors, bugs, and broken mechanics from Maelstrom PTR (Cataclysm) realm. The most active bug reporters will be rewarded on Maelstrom live realm!

# Report Template
When creating a bug report, be sure to name it accordingly ("[MAGE] Blink doesn't work" instead of "mage skill bugged"). Please follow the following template while creating a report:

**Description:**

Describe the bug you have encountered. Why do you think it's a bug?

**How to reproduce:**

Please explain what you did when you encountered the bug. What is your class, and where were you when it occurred. What can we do to reproduce the bug ourselves?

**How it should work:**

Please explain how should it work. Describe the expected behavior and back it with evidence, such as YouTube video/screenshot/comments from the relevant date (when WotLK was live on retail).

# When are you going to fix it?

We don't always fix bugs chronologically. Some bugs take more time to fix, while others take even as short as 2 minutes. Bugs are very often fixed based on severity, if there's a game-breaking issue, we will make sure to fix it first.
